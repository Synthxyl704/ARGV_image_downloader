# ARGV image downloader
A fun C project I wrote for extending my knowledge in network programming and client URL handlings and stuff.


## Linux/Terminal running commands and important notice[s]

Clone the project using this command onto bash:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Synthxyl704/waitabit
```

!IMPORTANT!

Remember to change the file pointer to the actual directory you want to store the image to!

```bash
 FILE *filePointer = "~./example/directory/here"
 ```

Linux terminal:
```
-> cd <directory_of_storage>
-> gcc isoimage.c -o isoimg -lcurl
-> ./isoimg <link_to_image>
```

## Definitely not FAQs again

#### Can it support image rescales?

Yes, I will try to find out a way to rescale images from terminal itself soon.

#### Why should I use your project instead of just downloading from the site itself?

I plan on allowing image rescalings without quality loss, multiple file extension types flexibility, etc. from the terminal itself, will be pretty hand for you if you wish to not go through the hassle of manually downloading everything then again going to another site for rescaling and stuff.

#### Why is it still incomplete?

I started this project on 18th June as a means to extend my knowledge on basic client URL handling and network programming during my 1st year in university.
Suggestions and stuff is always recommended, please do send me those, if I am alive I will definitely read and reply to your suggestion/comment/note.

Very epic isnt it?
